## üöÄ Release

This library is hosted on [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com). To create a new release and publish to NPM:

1. Make sure you are on the `main` branch, have pulled the latest changes from GitHub, and have no local changes:

   ```shell
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git status
   ```

   The last command should return the following:

   ```shell
   On branch main
   Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```

2. Bump the version according to [semantic versioning rules](https://semver.org/)

   ```shell
   npm version major|minor|patch
   ```

3. Push the commit up to the GitHub repository

4. Make sure you are logged in as a user that has access to the [`@upstatement/puppy` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstatement/puppy)

   ```
